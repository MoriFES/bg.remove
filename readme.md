## New Modern UI (2025 Refresh)

The application now includes a redesigned interface with:

- Sleek responsive layout (desktop & mobile)
- Drag & drop uploading with progress animation
- Sideâ€‘byâ€‘side original vs transparent preview
- Animated skeleton placeholder while processing
- Oneâ€‘click dark / light theme toggle (persists via `localStorage`)
- Accessible keyboard navigation (press Enter/Space on the drop zone)

### Theme Customization

Themes are powered by CSS custom properties defined in `static/css/style.css` under the `:root` selector and the `html[data-theme='light']` override. To adjust branding:

1. Edit the `--accent` and `--accent-accent` variables.
2. Optionally add a `html[data-theme='solarized'] { ... }` block and toggle it via a custom control.

### File Size & Limits

The backend restricts uploads to 16MB (`app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH']`). You can raise this in `app.py` if needed.

### Clearing Temporary Files

Temporary originals and processed outputs are stored in `uploads/` and `processed/`. A placeholder "Clear Temp Files" button exists; you can implement a secure route to remove old files (ensure you **never** allow arbitrary path deletion).

Example route (add to `app.py` if desired):

```python
@app.post('/admin/clear-cache')
def clear_cache():
   for folder in [app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], app.config['PROCESSED_FOLDER']]:
      for name in os.listdir(folder):
         path = os.path.join(folder, name)
         if os.path.isfile(path):
            try: os.remove(path)
            except OSError: pass
   return jsonify({'status': 'ok'})
```

> Secure this endpoint (API key / auth) before exposing publicly.

### Roadmap Ideas

- Batch processing / queue
- Transparent background color replacement (e.g., pick white or custom color)
- Cropping / smart subject centering
- Download as ZIP for batches
- Progressive enhancement for offline mode
